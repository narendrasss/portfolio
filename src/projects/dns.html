            This program uses the DNS protocol to resolve domain names to IP
            addresses. The program is able to resolve to both IPv4 and IPv6
            addresses. It resolves using an <strong>iterative</strong> approach.
          </p>
          <p>To run the program you run the following command:</p>
          <pre><code>$ java -jar DNSLookupService.jar [DNS Server IP]</code></pre>
          <p>
            Alternatively, running <code>$ make run</code> will begin the
            program with the default name server &mdash; a name server close to
            UBC.
          </p>
          <p>
            The program then waits for more commands. It accepts the following
            as inputs:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>lookup (domain name) [query type]</code> - Looks up and
              returns the IP address of the given domain name. Query type can be
              one of A (IPv4), AAAA (IPv6), NS or CNAME. If left out it defaults
              to A.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>trace (on|off)</code> - Turns on/off verbose tracing. If
              this is on, it prints out every query and response the program
              makes to the DNS server(s).
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>server (ip)</code> - Changes the DNS server to
              <code>ip</code>.
            </li>
            <li><code>exit</code> - Terminates the program.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Development Notes</h2>
          <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
          <p>
            The hardest part about this program was to parse the response given
            from the server. What made this difficult was that the response is
            in hexadecimal form.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first thing that we did was to encapsulate all the logic that
            goes into parsing the response into a
            <code>DNSResponse</code> class. The main function can then call
            different getter functions for the different information contained
            in the server response:
          </p>
          <img
            src="../assets/dns/dns-response-class.svg"
            alt=""
            class="info__media"
          />
          <h3>Optimizations</h3>
          <h4>Domains</h4>
          <p>
            The server response is in the form of a compressed DNS response.
            That is if a domain name string is repeated, the string is
            represented as a pointer to the first occurence of the domain
            instead of the domain itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, domains with a substring that was seen before is also
            represented as a pointer. Thus the domain parser may potentially
            have to repeatedly go back even if the domain was parsed before.
          </p>
          <p>
            I avoided this problem by using Java's built in
            <code>HashMap</code> data structure to store the domains. Each
            domain is represented by its offset from the beginning of the
            response:
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/dns/hashmap.svg" alt="" class="info__media" />
          <p>
            Our domain parser will then check in the map first to see if the
            domain was previously parsed. If not, the parser gets the domain and
            puts the domain into the map:
          </p>
          <img
            src="../assets/dns/domain-parser.svg"
            alt=""
            class="info__media"
          />
          <h4>Search</h4>
          <p>
            Often we will receive responses with a CNAME that the DNS server has
            an answer for, but is not exactly what we originally queried:
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/dns/compress-1.svg" alt="" class="info__media" />
          <p>
            It is redundant to query for <code>github.com</code> again when the
            answer is already given to us. Our program gets around this by
            <em>compressing</em> the answers, that is it will turn the above
            response into the following record:
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/dns/compress-2.svg" alt="" class="info__media" />
          <p>Which is the record that we were originally looking for.</p>
          <p>Similarly we might encounter a CNAME chain:</p>
          <img src="../assets/dns/compress-3.svg" alt="" class="info__media" />
          <p>
            Through the same process our program will compress this into one
            record, removing the need to query the first CNAME(s):
          </p>
